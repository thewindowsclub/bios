A computer's BIOS (basic input/output) is its motherboard firmware, the software that runs at a lower level than the operating system and tells the computer what drive to boot from, how much RAM you have, and controls other vital details like CPU frequency. You can go into the BIOS menu to change your boot order, overclock your PC, disable onboard peripherals, or even set a master password.

Before it loads Windows or Linux, BIOS first runs a Power-On Self Test (POST) to make sure hardware is working right. After POST is complete, the PC will start turning on. At this point, BIOS finds the Master Boot Record (MBR) to complete the boot.

## How to Access BIOS

The BIOS is accessed and configured through the BIOS Setup Utility. The BIOS Setup Utility is, for all practical purposes, the BIOS itself. All available options in BIOS are configurable through the BIOS Setup Utility.

Unlike an operating system like Windows, which is often downloaded or obtained on a disc and needs to be installed by the user or manufacturer, BIOS comes installed from the moment the machine is manufactured.

The BIOS Setup Utility is accessed in various ways depending on your computer or motherboard make and model.

## How to Use BIOS ?

BIOS supports several hardware configuration options that can be changed through the setup utility. Saving these changes and restarting the computer applies the changes to the BIOS and alters the way BIOS instructs the hardware to function.

**Here are some common things you can do in most BIOS systems:**

* Change the Boot Order
* Load BIOS Setup Defaults
* Flash (Update) BIOS
* Remove a BIOS Password
* Create a BIOS Password
* Change the Date and Time
* Change Floppy Drive Settings
